# Book Store Application<br>
1. Introduction<br>
&emsp;&emsp;This proposed Java application would be an offline application through which customers can buy the books from the "BUYBOOK" store. The "BUYBOOK" store provides electronic books and paper books. The "BUYBOOK" store includes fiction and non-fiction books.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;First, the customer must create an account before logging in if they didn't sign up. To practice the one-click technique, the customer must provide credit card information in creating the account step. After that, they must log in to their account. After login into the application, the customer can surf through the application and get access to the future. Besides keeping the record of book inventories, this software will keep customers' information and accept credit cards for payment. Customers can sort the books by their name, rate, and price.<br>

2. Features<br>
Some of the features of the “BUYBOOK” store are as follows:<br>
• Categorizing of books based on fiction, or non-fiction<br>
• Keeping record of the books inventory<br>
• Keeping record of the customers' information<br>
• Showing the status of availability of paper books<br>
